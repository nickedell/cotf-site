title: Decision Chain
layout: layouts/base.njk
audienceIntro: |
  Consulting has always been defined by workflows: research → design → delivery → reporting. With AI, those workflows no longer run linearly. They become dynamic cycles where AI proposes, predicts, and coordinates — and humans oversee, contextualise, and guide.

  We call this the **Decision Chain**. At every stage — from scanning signals, framing opportunities, designing solutions, predicting feasibility, orchestrating delivery, to realising value — AI is embedded. But the human role is essential: ensuring trust, nuance, and accountability.

  This model is what separates AI-enabled consulting from automation. It ensures consultants remain in control of context and value, while AI accelerates the mechanics beneath them.
