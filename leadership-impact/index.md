title: Leadership Impact

audienceIntro: |
  For senior leaders, the real question is not *if* AI changes consulting, but *what it demands of us*. The implications cut across tools, hiring, skills, offers, and client relationships.

  We must equip our people with secure, firmwide AI platforms. We must hire for adaptability, empathy, and fluency with AI. We must train every consultant to prompt, validate, and orchestrate AI in their daily workflow. We must reshape our offers around outcomes, not billable hours. And we must position ourselves with clients not as providers, but as co-creators.

  The leadership challenge is cultural as much as technical: to model AI adoption, sponsor pilots, measure impact, and share stories of success. The partners and managing partners who act decisively will define the trajectory of Infosys Consulting in the AI era.
