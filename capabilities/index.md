title: Our Capabilities
layout: layouts/base.njk
audienceIntro: |
  Capabilities define what consultants can actually do. They are the levers of impact. But the shape of those capabilities is changing rapidly.

  In the near term, research, proposal writing, and feasibility testing will be compressed by AI — freeing consultants to focus on higher-order work. In the mid-term, we will see AI assembling project teams dynamically, monitoring delivery in real time, and enriching knowledge assets across the firm. In the long term, AI will move into prototyping, persistent client co-creation, and predictive strategy.

  This is not a replacement story. It is an evolution: consultants at every grade will build new capabilities that expand their impact. The roadmap shows what to expect and when — and ensures we are ready to train, support, and equip our people as these shifts land.
