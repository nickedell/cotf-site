# 🖥️ Consultant of the Future Microsite — UI/UX Brief for Gemini

## Global Elements

* **Nav order (narrative arc):** Home → POV → Evidence → Capabilities → Roles → Decision Chain → Leadership Impact → Client Kit → Workshop.
* **Toggle at top-right:** Switch between **Presentation Mode** (short bullets, visuals, data) and **Audience Mode** (adds 1–3 paras of explanatory text with heading).
* **Style:** Swiss-modern grid, clean typography, responsive, minimal colour palette. Avoid “sci-fi” clichés.

### **1. Home (Hook)**

* **Hero split screen:** Left = “Today” (consultant in traditional workflow), Right = “Tomorrow” (AI-augmented workflow).

## Implementation Notes for Gemini

* Audience Mode content already exists in text; simply surface under new **headings** listed above.
* Each section should render clean in Presentation Mode without the Audience panel.
* Timeline, circular flows, role maps → ideally interactive (d3.js / chart lib).
* Grid and card components → reusable React/Tailwind UI blocks.

Would you like me to also **prepare a dev-ready JSON or YAML config** for Gemini so the page structure + headings are machine-readable (not just prose)? That would let Gemini scaffold pages directly from the brief.
