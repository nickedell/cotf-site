	<h1>Consulting is being re-architected in months, not years.</h1>
</div>

<div class="grid-main-content">
	The old role-based hierarchy will evolve into dynamic capability systems where AI handles most assembly work and humans focus on curation, validation and orchestration. [cite: 105] [cite_start]Our advantage: strategic foresight, domain expertise, engineered delivery + proprietary technology — all making our AI strategies more defensible, actionable and lower-risk than those of pure-play advisors. [cite: 106]</p>

	<h2>The Imperative</h2>
	[cite_start]<p>The market is facing four key shifts: <strong>market disruption</strong> where small AI-enabled teams can rival global firms [cite: 108][cite_start]; a <strong>compression of time</strong> where work that took weeks is now done in hours [cite: 109][cite_start]; evolving <strong>client expectations</strong> where faster, adaptive delivery is the default [cite: 110][cite_start]; and new <strong>talent expectations</strong> where consultants want AI-augmented, high-value work[cite: 111].</p>

	<h2>Signals of Change</h2>
</div>

<div class="grid-main-content horizontal-group cols-3">
	<div class="group-item">
		<h3>Evolving Titles</h3>
		[cite_start]<p>Partners will focus more on Market Orchestration [cite: 114][cite_start], Principals on Complex Engagement Design [cite: 115][cite_start], Consultants on Solution Curation [cite: 116][cite_start], and Analysts on Information Strategy & Verification[cite: 117].</p>

		<h3>Impact in 90 Days</h3>

	</div>
	<div class="group-item">
		<h3>Decision Clarity</h3>
		[cite_start]<p>We can use AI to predict delivery feasibility before pitching [cite: 123] [cite_start]and monitor change adoption in real time [cite: 124][cite_start], allowing humans to control value, context, and trust[cite: 125].</p>
