	<h1>Consulting is being re-architected in months, not years.</h1>
</div>

<div class="grid-main-content">
	<p>The old role-based hierarchy will evolve into dynamic capability systems where AI handles most assembly work and humans focus on curation, validation and orchestration. Our advantage: strategic foresight, domain expertise, engineered delivery + proprietary technology — all making our AI strategies more defensible, actionable and lower-risk than those of pure-play advisors.</p>

	<h2>The Imperative</h2>
	<p>The market is facing four key shifts: <strong>market disruption</strong> where small AI-enabled teams can rival global firms; a <strong>compression of time</strong> where work that took weeks is now done in hours; evolving <strong>client expectations</strong> where faster, adaptive delivery is the default; and new <strong>talent expectations</strong> where consultants want AI-augmented, high-value work.</p>

	<h2>Signals of Change</h2>
